1. Describe the properties of different types of radioactive decay. Write nuclear equations for radioactive decay, fusion, and fission processes.

## X-rays (or something)

X-ray
- Discovered while doing experiments with cathode rays on fluorescence in vacuum tubes.
- X-rays are high-energy photons that are produced when electrons are accelerated and collide with a metal target.
- Had properties of luminescence & penetrating radiation.
- Discovered by Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen in 1895, who immediatly takes a photo of his wife's hand via X-ray to flex on people (he flexes the wedding ring as well).


## Decay

**Alpha Decay:** Emission of 4/2 He from a nucleus.
> *Example:* $$_{92}^{238}U \rightarrow _{90}^{234}Th + _{2}^{4}He^{2+}$$

**Beta Decay:** Emission of an electron from the nucleus
> *Example:* $$_{6}^{14}C \rightarrow _{7}^{14}N + e^-$$

Given an element:
> $$_{A}^{B}El^{C}$$

- El = Element
- A = Mass Number (protons + neutrons)
- B = Atomic Number (protons)
- C = Charge (protons - electrons)

Pulling an Ethan Wu and writing 
> $$ _{4}^{4}He^{2+}$$

instead of

> $$ _{2}^{4}He^{2+}$$

is **not** the the superior strategy.
