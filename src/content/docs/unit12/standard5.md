(1) Identify molecular substances that can exhibit hydrogen bonding as pure substances or in a mixture.

## Hydrogen Bonding

In hydrogen bonding, a Î´+ hydrogen is strongly attached to a lone pair. There are criteria for molecules to experience hydrogen bonding:
- The hydrogen is attached directly to a highly electronegative atoms, causing the hydrogen to acquire a highly positive charge.
- Each of the highly electronegative atoms attains a high negative charge and has at least one "active" lone pair. 

Essentially, hydrogen bonding can only happen between a hydrogen and one of N, O or F. The large electronegative difference between N, O, or F, and hydrogen, a very strong dipole-dipole-like relationship occurs, where hydrogen is very positively charged while the other atom is very negatively charged.
