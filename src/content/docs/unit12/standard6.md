1. Predict physical properties (relative BP, MP, VP, solubility/miscibility) of molecular substances and polymers based on the strength of their intermolecular forces.

## Physical Properties As Predicted By IMF

Relative BP, MP, and VP increase with stronger IMF. Meanwhile, molecules with stronger IMF have lower solubility/miscibility.
