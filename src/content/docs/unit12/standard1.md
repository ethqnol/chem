(1) Represent a molecule or ion with a Lewis structure. Make predictions of relative BDEs from Valence Bond Theory.

## What Is A Lewis Structure?

**Lewis Structure:** A very simplified representation of the valence shell electrons in a molecule. Electrons are shown as dots.

## Drawing A Lewis Structure

1. Determine the # of valence electrons in the the structure.
2. Draw the skeletal formula of the molecule. (The central atom forms the most bonds)
3. Decrease the count of valence electrons by the electrons that were used in the bonds (single bonds are 2 electrons, double bonds 4, and triple bonds have 6).
4. For the remaining electrons, fill in the atoms until the octet is complete (valence shell is full) or until you run out of electrons.
