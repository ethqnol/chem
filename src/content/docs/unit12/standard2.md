1.  Write the full and net ionic equations for a reaction and identify spectator ions.

## VSEPR

**VSEPR:** Stands for valence-shell electron-pair repulsion, and it is a model that tells us about the geometric arrangements of electron pairs around a central atom in terms of the electrostatic repulsion between electron pairs.

There are two rules for VSEPR:
1. Double & triple bonds can effectively be treated as single bonds; the approximation suffices for the qualitative purposes of this model.
2. If a molecule has two or more resonance structures, VSEPR can be applied to any of them.

Using VSEPR, it is possible to predict the geometry of molecules.

| Number of Electron Pairs | Configuration of Electrons | Geometry | Examples |
| ---------------------- | -------------| -------------| ------------|
| 2 | 180 Degrees | Linear | $$BeCl_2$$|
| 3 | 120 Degrees | Trigonal | $$BF_3$$|
| 4 | 109.5 Degrees | Tetrahedral | $$CH_4$$|
