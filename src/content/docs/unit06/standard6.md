title: Reaction Rates
---

1. The progress of a reaction can be monitored by graphing changes in mass, pressure, volume, temperature, or absorbance as a function of time.
2. The slope of this graph is related to the rate of the reaction
3. Reaction rate data can be presented numerically or as qualitative observations

## Reaction Rates

:::note

It is not necessary to know these quantitatively; just which factors can speed up a reaction.

:::

1. Chemical nature of reacting substances
2. Physical state of reactants (smaller particles in liquid/gas phase have more surface area to touch other reacting substances)
3. Temperature of reactants (reaction rates double for every 10Â°C increase)
4. Concentration of reactants (more reactants = more collisions)
5. Presence of a catalyst (lowers activation energy)
