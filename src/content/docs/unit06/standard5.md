title: Collision Theory
---

In order for some particles to interact, they must *collide*; thus, by
increasing the number of collisions, we can increase the rate of the reaction:

$\text{rate} \propto \cfrac{\text{# collisions}}{\text{time}}$

This explains the dependence of a reaction rate on concentration; if there are
fewer particles, there are fewer collisions and thus fewer reactions. This also
explains the relationship between temperature and reaction rate; the higher the
temperature, the more the particles are moving, and the higher the chance
they'll collide with enough energy to react.
