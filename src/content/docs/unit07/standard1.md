1. Identify and describe qualitative and quantitative properties of elements.
2. Classify elements as metals, metalloids, or non-metals.
3. Classify elements according to chemical group.

## Properties of Elements

**Metals:**
- Shiny
- Malleable/Ductile
- Good conductors of heat and electricity
- High melting and boiling points

**Non-Metals:**
- Not shiny
- Brittle
- Poor conductors of heat and electricity

**Semiconductors:**
- Carbon, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium
- Conductivity increases with temperature

## Classification of Elements

** Group 1: Alkali Metals** 
- Soft, shiny, low melting points
- React violently with water
- Form +1 ions
- Largest atomic radius

** Group 2: Alkaline Earth Metals**
- Harder, denser, and stronger than alkali metals
- Form +2 ions
- High melting points and boiling points

** Group 3-12: Transition Metals**
- Good conductors of heat and electricity

** Group 13-16: Other Metals**
- Metalloilds: B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te (Above the staircase)
- Anything above the metalliods are non-metals
- Anything below the metalliods are metals

** Group 17: Halogens**
- Highly reactive non-metals
- Form -1 ions
- High electronegativity

** Group 18: Noble Gases**
- Do not react with other elements
