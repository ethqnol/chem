1. Identify the type of a chemical reaction
2. Predict the product(s) of a chemical reaction

## Reaction Types

| Reaction Name | General Equation | 
| --- | --- |
| Synthesis | $$ A + B \rightarrow AB $$ |
| Decomposition | $$ AB \rightarrow A + B $$ |
| Single Replacement | $$ A + BC \rightarrow AC + B $$ |
| Double Replacement | $$ AB + CD \rightarrow AD + CB $$ |
| Combustion | $$ C_xH_y + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O $$ |
