1. Determine the identity of a precipitate from experimental data


## Precipitates

Precipitate problems are basically logic games:

> Identify the solid formed
>
> $$ Li_{2}S (aq) + ZnBr_{2} (aq) \rightarrow \text{off-white precipitate} $$
> $$ K_{2}S (aq) + ZnBr_{2} (aq) \rightarrow \text{off-white precipitate} $$ \
> $$ Li_{2}O + 2NaBr \rightarrow \text{no reaction} $$

In this case, the precipitate is zinc sulfide. From the first 2 equations, we can tell that zinc sulfide, lithium bromide, and potassium bromide are the only possible products. However, the final equation shows us that lithium bromide is not a product. Since the white precipitate must show up in both of the first 2 equations, and the only common product between the 2 reactions in the first equation is zinc sulfide, the precipitate must be zinc sulfide.
