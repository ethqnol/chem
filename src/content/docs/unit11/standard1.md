1. Write the full and net ionic equations for a reaction and identify
spectator ions.

# Ionic Equations

An equation that involves ions smh. Where the formulas of the dissolved aqueous
solutions (a salt) are written as individual ions, i.e. because they are
*dissociated*.

So, for some silver bromide dissolved in water, it'd be:

> $Ag^{1+}_{(aq)} + Br^{1-}_{(aq)}$

...And NOT

> $AgBr_{(aq)}$
