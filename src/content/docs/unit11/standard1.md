1. Write the full and net ionic equations for a reaction and identify spectator
   ions.

## Ionic Equations

Ionic equations are those where the formulas of the dissolved aqueous solutions
(salts) are written as individual ions, i.e. because they are *dissociated*.

So, for some silver bromide dissolved in water, it'd be:

$$$$$\text{Ag}^{1+}_{(aq)} + \text{Br}^{1-}_{(aq)}$

With the *molecular equation*:

$$$$$\text{AgBr}_{(aq)}$

## Full & Net Ionic Equations, as well as Spectator Ions

Ions that don't contribute to the reaction once dissociated.

If you mixed some $\text{AgNO}_3$ with some $\text{NaBr}$ and dissolved them in water, you'd
get the following 4 ions:

$$$$$\text{Ag}^{1+}_{(aq)} + \text{NO}_{3(aq)}^{1-} + \text{Na}_{(aq)}^{1+} + \text{Br}_{(aq)}^{1-}$

Imagine this reacts to form some kinda *crust*, e.g. $\text{AgBr}_{(s)}$. The *full
ionic equation*'d look like this:

$$$$$\text{Ag}^{1+}_{(aq)} + \text{NO}_{3(aq)}^{1-} + \text{Na}_{(aq)}^{1+} + \text{Br}_{(aq)}^{1-} \to \text{AgBr}_{(s)} + \text{Na}_{(aq)}^{1+} + \text{NO}_{3(aq)}^{1-}$

You, with your redoubtable intellectual ability, may notice a couple of those
aren't doing anything; namely, $\text{Na}_{(aq)}^{1+}$ and $\text{NO}_{3(aq)}^{1-}$. These're
the *spectator ions*, because they'ren't involved in the reaction. To make
things cleaner, you can remove them to construct the *net ionic equation*:

$$$$$\text{Ag}^{1+}_{(aq)} + \text{Br}_{(aq)}^{1-} \to \text{AgBr}_{(s)}$
