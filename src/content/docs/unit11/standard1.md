1. Write the full and net ionic equations for a reaction and identify spectator
   ions.

# Ionic Equations

Ionic equations are those where the formulas of the dissolved aqueous solutions
(salts) are written as individual ions, i.e. because they are *dissociated*.

So, for some silver bromide dissolved in water, it'd be:

$Ag^{1+}_{(aq)} + Br^{1-}_{(aq)}$

With the *molecular equation*:

$AgBr_{(aq)}$

# Full & Net Ionic Equations, as well as Spectator Ions

Ions that don't contribute to the reaction once dissociated.

If you mixed some $AgNO_3$ with some $NaBr$ and dissolved them in water, you'd
get the following 4 ions:

$Ag^{1+}_{(aq)} + NO_{3(aq)}^{1-} + Na_{(aq)}^{1+} + Br_{(aq)}^{1-}$

Imagine this reacts to form some kinda *crust*, e.g. $AgBr_{(s)}$. The *full
ionic equation*'d look like this:

$Ag^{1+}_{(aq)} + NO_{3(aq)}^{1-} + Na_{(aq)}^{1+} + Br_{(aq)}^{1-} \to
AgBr_{(s)} + Na_{(aq)}^{1+} + NO_{3(aq)}^{1-}$

You, with your redoubtable intellectual ability, may notice a couple of those
aren't doing anything; namely, $Na_{(aq)}^{1+}$ and $NO_{3(aq)}^{1-}$. These're
the *spectator ions*, because they'ren't involved in the reaction. To make
things cleaner, you can remove them to construct the *net ionic equation*:

$Ag^{1+}_{(aq)} + Br_{(aq)}^{1-} \to AgBr_{(s)}$
