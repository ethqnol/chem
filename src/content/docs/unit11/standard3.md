1. Predict the products and thermodynamic favorability of single displacement
   reactions and relate experimental data to an activity series.

# Single Displacement Reactions

Redox reaction in which an ion in solution is displaced via the oxidation of a
metallic element. E.g.:

$Zn_{(s)} + 2HCl_{(aq)} \to ZnCl_{2(aq)} + H_{2(g)}$
