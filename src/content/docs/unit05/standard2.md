1. Use the ideal gas law and molar volume of a gas to convert between moles and volume of gas, and relate molar mass to gas density.

## Some Formulas

> $$ P \propto \frac{n}{VT} $$
>
> $$ PV = nRT $$

Molar volume of a gas at STP is 22.7 (or 22.4 depending on the standard being used) L/mol.

P = pressure
V = volume
n = number of moles
T = temperature
R = ideal gas constant (0.0821 L atm / mol K)

## Ideal Gas Law

**Ideal Gas Law:** Any gas at ideal conditions (100kPa, 1 mol, 273.15K) will be 22.7L in volume.

If the conditions are not ideal, meaning the gas is not at 100kPa, 1 mol, **and** 273.15K, then the volume of the gas will be different, and the formula $$ PV = nRT $$ can be used.

## [Advanced] Partial Pressure

**Partial Pressure:** The pressure of a gas in a mixture of gases. The total pressure of a gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases.

> $$ P_{total} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + ... P_n $$

**Mole Fraction in relation with Partial Pressure:** $$ P_A= χ_A \times P_{tot} $$ where $$ χ_A $$ is the mole fraction of gas A.
