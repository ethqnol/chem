1. Perform conversions involving molarity
2. Write the steps of a procedure to make a solution of a specific and precise concentration from a solid sample or a stock solution of known concentration

## Molarity

**Molarity:** Measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution. It is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. For example, if a solution contains 1 mole of NaCl in 1 liter of water, the molarity of the solution is 1 M. If 1 mole of NaCl is dissolved in 2 liters of water, the molarity is 0.5 M.

To solve molarity problems, set up dimensional analysis. For example, if a 45.3 g sample of NaCl is dissolved in 1.5 L of water, the molarity of the solution is: 

$$ 45.3 g \times \frac{1 mol}{58.44 g} \times \frac{1}{1.5 L} = 0.52 M $$

## Making a Solution of a Specific Concentration
Given a type of element, and a desired molarity, the steps to make a solution of a specific concentration are essentially the steps to calculate molarity given a mass and volume of solution, but in reverse. For example, to make a 250 ml and 0.5 M solution of NaCl:

$$ 250 ml \times \frac{1 L}{1000 ml} \times 0.5 M = 0.125 mol $$
