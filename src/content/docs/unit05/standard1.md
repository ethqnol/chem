1. Convert between mass and moles of a sample
2. Distinguish and convert between moles of atoms and molecules

## Converting Between Mass and Moles
**Moles:** An arbitrary number of atoms ($$6.022 \times 10^23$$) to help measurementâ€™s / equations.

- Mass of one mole of a given element is the atomic mass number in grams
- Molar mass has the unit g/mol
- Convert between mass and moles by setting up dimensional analysis. For example, to convert 5.0 g of Na to moles: $$ 5.0 g \times \frac{1 mol}{22.99 g} = 0.217 mol $$

## Distinguish Between Moles of Atoms and Molecules
- Moles of atoms is the total number of different atoms. For example, the moles of atoms in 1 mole of NaCl is 1 mole of Na and 1 mole of Cl, or 2 moles.

## [Advanced] Mole Fraction

**Mole Fraction:** The ratio of the number of moles of a component to the total number of moles in a mixture. For example, the mole fraction of NaCl in a solution of 1 mole of NaCl and 1 mole of H2O is: $$ \frac{1 mol}{1 mol + 1 mol} = 0.5 $$

For a mixture of 2 substances, A & B:

> $$ X_A = \frac{n_A}{n_A + n_B} $$ and $$ X_B = \frac{n_B}{n_A + n_B} $$
