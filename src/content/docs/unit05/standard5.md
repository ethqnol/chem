## Finding Limiting and Excess Reagents

**Limiting Reagent:** The reactant that is completely consumed in a chemical reaction. The amount of product formed is limited by this reactant.

**Excess Reagent:** The reactant that is not completely consumed in a chemical reaction. There is more of this reactant than is needed to react with the limiting reagent.

To find the limiting reagent, calculate the amount of product that can be formed from each reactant. The reactant that produces the least amount of product is the limiting reagent. For example, if $$Al$$ and $$Fe_{2}O_{3}$$ react to form $$Fe$$ and $$Al_{2}O_{3}$$, and you are given that there is only 6.00 g of aluminum and 16.0 g of rust:

> Balanced equation: $$2Al + Fe_{2}O_{3} \rightarrow 2Fe + Al_{2}O_{3}$$
>
> $$ 6.00 \ g \ Al * (\frac{1 mol}{26.982 g}) = 0.222 \ mol \ Al $$
>
> $$ 16.0 \ g \ Fe_{2}O_{3} * (\frac{1 mol}{159.69 g}) = 0.100  \ mol  \  Fe_{2}O_{3} $$
>
> Because $$ 0.222  \ mol  \ Al \times (\frac{1 mol Fe_{2}O_{3}}{2 mol Al}) = 0.111 \  mol  \  Fe_{2}O_{3} > 0.100 \  mol  \ Fe_{2}O_{3} $$,  $$Fe_{2}O_{3}$$ is the limiting reagent, making Al the excess reagent.

## Theoretical Yield

In the previous problem, knowing now that all 0.100 mol of $$Fe_{2}O_{3}$$ will react, we can calculate the theoretical yield of $$Fe$$ by drawing a BCA (Before, Change, After) table:

> Balanced equation: $$2Al + Fe_{2}O_{3} \rightarrow 2Fe + Al_{2}O_{3}$$

| | $$Fe_{2}O_{3}$$ | $$2Al$$ | $$2Fe$$ | $$Al_{2}O_{3}$$ |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Before| 0.100 mol | 0.222 mol | 0 | 0 |
|Change| -0.100 mol | -0.200 mol | 0.200 mol | 0.100 mol |
|After| 0 | 0.022 mol | 0.200 mol | 0.100 mol |

:::tip

To figure out how many moles of products are formed, look at the coefficients in the balanced equation. In this case, 2 moles of $$Fe$$ are formed for every 1 mole of $$Fe_{2}O_{3}$$ that reacts, so Fe's theoretical yield is 0.200 mol. Similarly, 0.100 mol of $$Al_{2}O_{3}$$ is formed because $$Al_{2}O_{3}$$'s coefficient has a ratio of 1 with $$Fe_{2}O_{3}$$.

## % Yield

**Percent Yield:** $$ \% \ yield = \frac{actual \ yield}{theoretical \ yield} \times 100 \% $$
