1. Convert between structural, line, and skeletal formulas.
2. Predict possible structural isomers associated with a molecular formula.

## Converting Between Formulas

### Structural Formula

Classic letters & lines.

Molecular formula: $\text{H}_2\text{O}$

Molecular formula: $\text{C}_8\text{H}_{18}$ (octane)

Doesn't show true shape, only bonds between atoms.

### Line Formula

Used specifically for organic chemistry; removes the clutter of $\text{C}$s and
$\text{H}$s.

Molecular formula: $\text{C}_8\text{H}_{18}$ (octane)

### Skeletal Formula

## Isomers

Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula, but different
structures. There are two categories of isomers:

### Structural Isomers

A structural isomer has the same number of atoms of each element (thus the same
molecular formula), but the atoms are *connected* in different ways.

### Stereoisomers

A stereoisomer has the same atoms connected in the same way, but in a different
shape.
