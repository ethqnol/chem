(1) Predict and explain electronic properties of atoms (IE, EA, radius) in terms of the shell model.

## Photoelectron Spectroscopy

**Photoelectron Spectroscopy** is a technique used to determine the ionization energy of an atom, where atoms are bombarded with monochromatic X-rays. The energy of the X-rays is gradually increased until an electron is ejected from the atom. 

> $$X(g) + h * v \rightarrow X^+ + e^-$$

IE can be found using a similar technique as Hess's Law. IE is determined by measuring the ejected electron's kinetic energy.

Successive IEs for multielectrons are defined as followes:

> $$IE_1: X(g) \rightarrow X^+ + e^-$$
> $$IE_2: X^+(g) \rightarrow X^{2+} + e^-$$
> $$IE_3: X^{2+}(g) \rightarrow X^{3+} + e^-$$
> $$IE_n: X^{(n-1)+}(g) \rightarrow X^{n+} + e^-$$

## Graphs of Successive IEs
- Groups of 2 for ground state electrons (highest IE)
- Groups of 8 for electron orbits for core electrons
- Between 0-8 for valence electrons (lowest IE)
- IE is increasing on the graph because each orbit has a different IE
- IE is increasing within orbits since as electrons leave, the remaining electrons are less repelled because less electrons are now in the orbit.

:::note[IE Trends]
IE increases across a period and decreases down a group. That is to say, helium has the highest IE, since it is furthest to the right and highest up on the periodic table.

## Electron Affinity

**Electron Affinity** is the energy change that occurs when an electron is added to a gaseous atom to form a negative ion. EA is *kind of* the opposite of IE. EA becomes more negative (increases) as you move across a period and becomes less negative (decreases) as you move down a group.

## ENC & Shielding

Electrons that are sufficiently far away from the nucleus will not experience the full charge from the nucleus (called ùëç), because the electrons in orbit around the nucleus will cancel out part of the charge. 

The charge that the valence electrons experience is called the **Effective Nuclear Charge (ENC)**. ENC is the charge that the valence electrons experience, which is less than the actual charge of the nucleus, becaeuse of the afformentioned shielding effect.
